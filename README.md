React Native components for ReactJS

# React Components 

I created a bunch of components in React that have similar code execution and integration as the React Native components.
Some of them are : 

- Button
- FlatList
- HeaderText
- Image
- NumberInput
- Pressable
- Text
- TextInput
- TouchableHighlight
- View
- Carousel
- CheckBox
- Navbar
- Notification
- Picker
- ProgressBar
- RadioButton
- ScrollView
- Slider

# React Style

We can use styles in React as React Native *StyleSheet* approach.
Here's an example :

``` 
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  button : {
    backgroundColor: 'red',
    color: 'white',
    padding: '10px 20px',
    border: 'none',
    borderRadius: '5px',
    cursor: 'pointer'
  },
  pressButton : {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    width: '20%',
    height: '20%',
    border: 'none',
    borderRadius: '5px',
    cursor: 'pointer'
  },
  image:{
    width: '20%',
    height: '10%',
  }
});
```

# Why

I was tired of writing my JavaScript Engine in HTML and CSS for the design so I decided to use React, but I found out that is not the same as React Native, so I created this custom tags for better.
